# 🚑 Rapid Response

> **Team Code Runners** | *Tech Sprint Hackathon 2026*

**Rapid Response** is a centralized accident reporting and emergency dispatch system designed to reduce response times in critical situations in Nepal by enabling real-time reporting, verification, and coordinated emergency response.

## 🚩 Problem Statement

Even with Nepal’s growing digital landscape, emergency response systems remain disconnected and slow. Most accidents are still reported via phone calls, leading to several critical issues:

- **Inaccurate Location Sharing**  
  People often struggle to describe the exact accident location, causing delays—especially in crowded urban areas.

- **Disconnected Communication**  
  Emergency services such as police, ambulances, and hospitals operate independently. Contacting each service separately results in poor coordination and delayed response.

- **Lack of Hospital Readiness**  
  Hospitals rarely receive advance notice about incoming emergency patients, leaving them unprepared to deliver immediate, life-saving care.

- **No Verification or Tracking System**  
  Without a centralized platform, it is difficult to verify the authenticity of reports or track response times, leading to resource wastage and false reports.

Without a centralized, real-time emergency reporting and verification platform, response delays will continue to result in preventable loss of life and property damage.

## 💡 Our Solution

An integrated application where a citizen can report an accident with **one tap**. The system uses:


- **Real-Time Geolocation** to identify the incident location  
- **Instant Dispatch** to notify the nearest hospitals, police station and available ambulance providers
- **Live Dashboard** for emergency responders to monitor and act immediately
- **AI-Based Verification** to validate accident images using pretrained EfficientNet-B0 fine tuned with real data
